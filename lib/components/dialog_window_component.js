/** This component is almost like ModalWindowComponent with one major difference:
  * the `#completed` property returns a Future which may later be used
  * to run code upon the the DialogWindow closure.
  *
  * Additionally, it automatically adds buttons which all close the window,
  * but return different values from the Future. That way, you can determine
  * which button was pressed and run the aprropriate code.
  *
  * Example.
  * A dialog window that asks to confirm the removal of a user's blog post would
  * have two buttons: "Yes" and "No". Clicking the first one, makes
  * the DialogWindow Future complete with `true`, while clicking the second
  * one makes it complete with `false`.
  *
  * Which buttons return what is determined by the `#options` property -
  * read documentation on it to understand how to have the buttons you want to.
  * You can pass a value for this property as a second argument to the constructor.
  *
  * The options that were passed as a second argument to the ModalWindowComponent's
  * constructor are no longer available and are set to sane defaults - a dialog window
  * is a little less flexible in terms of how you can close it!
