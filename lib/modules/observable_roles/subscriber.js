/**
 * Watches publishers for events they emit, then reacts to each event by invoking event handlers.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *
 * 1. Define event handlers using the `event_handlers` property in the constructor:
 *
 *   this.event_handlers = new EventHandlersMap({
 *     'mouseover' : {
 *       '#all':         (self, p) => print("A default event handler for all publishers, irrespective of their roles"),
 *       'button':       (self, p) => print("An event handler for publishers with the 'button' role only"),
 *       'button, link': (self, p) => print("An event handler for publishers with both 'button' AND 'link' roles")
 *     },
 *     'click' : {
 *       '#all' : (self, p) => print("A default event handler for all publishers, irrespective of their roles"),
 *     }
 *   }); 
 *
 * 2. Call `publishEvent('mouseover')` on the publisher.
 *
 * EXPLANATION:
 *
 * Subscriber objects are added into publisher's `Pubslisher#observing_subscribers` List.
 * Every time such a publisher publishes an event it makes sure our subscriber
 * is notified - that is achieved by calling the `captureEvent()` method.
 *
 * `captureEvent()` in turn, doesn't automatically execute the event handler,
 * but simply adds the event to queue. This is because we want to process events
 * one by one and the order of executing the handlers may matter. After the event
 * is added into the queue, it calls `_releaseQueuedEvents()` which invokes event
 * handlers for each event in the queue until it ends. Thus, it may happen so that
 * some calls to `_releaseQueuedEvents()` may actually be for nothing, since event B
 * previously added to the queue was released by the call made to `_releaseQueuedEvents()`
 * while event A was captured. This an unlikely situation, though.
 *
 * More importantly, each subscriber has a listening lock. When it's on (set to `true`),
 * events are captured (added to the queue), but handlers for them are not yet invoked.
 * as soon as the value of the listening lock changes to `false`, events start being released
 * by calling `_releaseQueuedEvents()`. This may be very useful in certain cases when
 * you have to make sure event handlers are invoked only when an object reaches a certain state,
 * but no earlier (example: process clicks only when the page is loaded).
